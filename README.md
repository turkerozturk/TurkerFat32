# TurkerFat32
My own Fat32 Partition Image Parser library and a simple GUI for it. Written in Java, the GUI is written in JavaFX.

It is for read only browsing. My code is not used in any proffesional project, therefore i can share it.

Try it!

A demo partition image is included with the executable; https://github.com/turkerozturk/TurkerFat32/releases/tag/v1.0.0

A demo video is available;
